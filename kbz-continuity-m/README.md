# INTRODUCTION

The continuity module introduces the concept of common knowledge formally into the Kanban-Zai file. 

The purpose of the continuity module is to create an objective standard by which knowledge continuity can be 
maintained across an evolving Kanban-Zai team.

# COMMON KNOWLEDGE

Common knowledge refers to any piece of information that is accepted and known so widely within a specific 
discipline that you do not need to cite it.

* It can be found in different sources, unreferenced.
* It may be attributed to a number of different authors.

Common knowledge can be subject-specific: concepts and information that are widely known in one team, for example, 
may not be widely known in another, and vice versa.

Broadly speaking, it is information that the average, educated person would accept as reliable without having to 
look it up.

It must be the goal of all Kanban-Zai teams adopting this module to transfer all knowledge to the status of 
common knowledge.  

Generally private knowledge is forbidden, while special case knowledge ( eg: passwords ) is allowed.

# COMMON KNOWLEDGE CHARTER

To permeate knowledge throughout, the team must keep records of the categories of information that are to be considered 
common knowledge by rostered members of the team and therefore can be purposefully discussed at every opportunity.  

This must be placed in the Kanban-Zai file under the top-level property "hints"

The charter must be kept current.  It is considered a living document without the need for deviation or consensus, but
may only be updated by rostered team members.
 
There are no strict requirements as to exactly what hints should be considered but more generalized hints take up less
space in the Kanban-Zai file and brevity makes it easier for humans to ingest.

It should be publicly available.
    
# SETTINGS

## documentation

Value: conservative ( READONLY )

Kanban-Zai regards written documentation as technical debt and allows internal team written documentation in the 
most conservative form only.  

If you can make a very good case, as a team, why something should be documented then do it, otherwise don't.

When a document is created, it is almost immediately out of date which breaks the team norm of relevance.

## transparency

Value: public ( READONLY )

All information related to the teams function is shared.  All work is public to all team members.  Private to do lists, 
are forbidden.  Only security information maybe stored on a need to know basis and only when essential.

# NORMS

## GOSSIP

Gossip in Kanban-Zai is required.  When you gossip with someone, you and the person you're talking to are displaying 
reciprocal trust.  TALK to your teammates. TALK to the client.  Practice this discipline at least daily.

## BREVITY

TMI is a funny TLA but in KBZ TMI is next to useless.  Keep it brief if, you are transferring knowledge.

## RELEVANCE

Relevance is important in all aspects of life, but more so in Kanban-Zai.  Relevance balances brevity.  Find a balance
between brevity and relevance in all communication.

## CLARITY

Clear communication is important. If your comms are not clear, you may as well not use comms


## Card Development 

"Writing cards is hard, the only good thing is breaking down stories into bite sized chunks" 
- Max Ashton, Kanban-Zai Guru.

* Cards are the basic work unit the triumvirate issues. 
* Cards must conform to the Kanban-Zai value of objectivity.
* Cards must meet the definition of "Card Ready" defined by the delivery team.


## Sowing

Sow knowledge throughout the team.  Do it often and don't keep secrets or silos.  The more information the team has in 
advance the more they can be prepared for what is to come.  Do it regularly.  Hourly maybe.

## Harvest

your team members grow their knowledge every day and reaping is the process of gathering and collecting the
jigsaw of knowledge that forms the product model.  This norm does not dictate how harvest should be done, only 
that it should be a regular part of your process.
