# kbz-triumvirate-m

The triumvirate consists of Technical Owner, Product Owner and Client.

It calls upon the specific competency's of the TO (Keeper of the technical rules) & PO  (keeper of the business rules) 
to minimise any ambiguity on the project and clarify dilemmas.
 
# CLAIMS

### CLIENT EXTENDS RATIONAL-OBSERVERS

It is the role of the client to frequently and consciously prioritize functionality into the delivery queue based 
upon the clients current understanding of market appetite.

This is a HARD TASK requiring courage of conviction to stay the course and choose advantageous deviations.

To filter the wheat from the chaff the client relies upon the Product Owner and the Technical Owner.  The client has 
the final word in the order of the work queue.

### PRODUCT OWNER EXTENDS RATIONAL-PLAYERS

The role of the product owner is "the keeper of knowledge".  The particular knowledge the PO keeps is the depth and
breadth of the business rules.  The PO must position themselves in front of all dilemmas raised by the team and resolve
as many as can be resolved.  What is left must be resolved by the business.

### TECHNICAL OWNER EXTENDS RATIONAL-PLAYERS

The role of Technical Owner is a recent one.  One that has arisen because of the reality of the ever-increasing 
complexity of the technical landscape.  The TO must advise to the best of their experience about the possible pitfalls
when weighing one technical choice above the other whilst accounting for the fact that business rules and technical 
rules do often collide and give rise to dilemmas that even the client may not be able to resolve.

 

### ACCEPTANCE-ROM

The triumvirate is responsible for accepting a card as done.  They must accept the card if it has broken the team
quality constraint, and it is found to be a true reflection of the value defined by the Triumvirate for that card.

# SETTINGS

## veto

Value: triumvirate. ( READ ONLY )

The client can choose to defer their veto vote to the triumvirate.  A veto allows the triumvirate to veto a consensus.
If this happens a journal entry must be raised and detailed information provided as to why the veto has occurred.

Regular vetoing is a red flag in Kanban-Zai, fight the power.  What is regular?  More than twice.  Ever.

### feedback 

Required Value: Data driven analytics preferred, but anecdotal evidence must not be ignored | READONLY

The Triumvirate and by extension the team, must not operate in an information vacuum.  Provisions must be made to
use evidence to drive triumvirate decisions.

Possible Values: daily, weekly, 2 weekly DEFAULT: weekly
   
re-prioritization of the work queue must happen regularly in the triumvirate.
